    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 14</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I focused on finalizing my project and preparing it for the final stages. I created a Hugging Face Spaces demo using a simplified frame, and I uploaded my fine-tuned BERT model to Hugging Face, making it accessible for demonstration. It explores how I used BERT to classify movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy. I also made significant progress on the project’s final steps, with just a few finishing touches left.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my main focus is on completing any remaining tasks. I plan to make sure everything is polished, including the Hugging Face demo, to showcase my results effectively. Additionally, I’ll review the documentation one last time to ensure it is clear. I’ll also finalize and work on the Final Project Report to the website, summarizing the entire project process, results, and conclusions.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    There are no significant impediments at the moment. The main task is ensuring all components of the project are cohesive and polished.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s focus on wrapping up the project and finalizing the Hugging Face demo went smoothly. I will continue to take the same organized approach in these final stages to ensure everything is ready for showcase. If I encounter any issues, I’ll focus on resolving them efficiently to stay on track.</p>

    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 10</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I finalized the evaluation of the fine-tuned BERT model and completed assessments of its performance metrics. The results have provided a clear picture of the model’s capabilities, and I feel confident about where it currently stands. In addition to finalizing the model’s evaluation, I continued gathering resources on alternative NLP techniques. While I haven’t implemented any new approaches, having these resources ready has been helpful for planning the next stages. I also began outlining the initial documentation for the website to prepare for sharing results in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I’ll consolidate the insights gathered from BERT’s evaluation and make any final adjustments needed based on those insights. If the model’s performance aligns with expectations, I’ll shift focus to drafting more comprehensive documentation of my process and results to be ready for the website update. I’ll also start to identify specific aspects of my findings that would be valuable to highlight, ensuring they are accessible and informative for the project’s audience.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No significant impediments right now. The main challenge will be ensuring the documentation is clear and organized, especially as I start preparing for a final presentation of the project results.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week, balancing model evaluation with initial documentation preparation worked well. This approach allowed me to stay organized without jumping into too many tasks at once. Moving forward, I’ll continue focusing on effective documentation practices, making sure I can clearly convey my findings and progress as I prepare for the final project stages.</p>

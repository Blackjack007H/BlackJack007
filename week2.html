    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 2</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    This past week, I created my personal web page, which will serve as a place to showcase my work and post weekly updates. Alongside that, I spent time thinking about my project topic and ultimately decided to focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I’m excited about the potential of this field and the opportunity to work on something practical and impactful. </p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I’ll begin setting up the project. Specifically, I’m diving into NLP by setting up my environment with Python and libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. My plan is to experiment with pre-trained models like BERT and fine-tune them using the IMDb movie review dataset. My goal is to have a simple sentiment analysis tool that can interpret user inputs and provide sentiment scores.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
     No significant obstacles at the moment, but I’ll need to invest time in learning how to fine-tune NLP models properly, as this is a key aspect of the project. I’ll also need to manage the time spent during the model training phase, as it can take some time depending on the data and model size.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week was primarily focused on planning and setup. While I made progress on the web page, I could have spent more time narrowing down the project topic earlier in the week. Going forward, I’ll focus on breaking tasks into more actionable steps, which will help me balance the project work more effectively.</p>

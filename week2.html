    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 2</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I created my personal web page and spent time deciding on the topic for my project. After some consideration, I chose to focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), which feels like an exciting area to dive into. I set up the basics for my environment, but there's still more work to be done to get everything running smoothly.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my main goals are to improve the website by refining the design and layout, making it more polished and user-friendly. Additionally, I plan to start working on the NLP project itself, which involves getting a solid understanding of how to approach the problem. I’ll begin by researching the best practices for using pre-trained models like BERT and exploring how to fine-tune them for sentiment analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No major impediments at the moment, but I’m aware that understanding how to work with NLP models, especially in terms of fine-tuning them, may require some extra learning. I’ll be focusing on breaking the problem into smaller steps so that I can approach it efficiently.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week was productive in terms of setting up the web page and deciding on a project topic, but I think I could have benefited from starting to dig into the technical details sooner. This week, I’ll focus on improving my time management by balancing the website improvements with the project work so that I can make progress on both fronts.</p>

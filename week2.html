    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 2</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I worked on improving the design and functionality of my website. I also spent time researching best practices for fine-tuning pre-trained NLP models like BERT, which will be a key part of my project.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I will focus on implementing the fine-tuning of BERT with the IMDb movie review dataset. Additionally, I plan to continue refining the website, ensuring it’s clean and easy to navigate for users.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No significant challenges have arisen so far. However, I'm preparing for possible slowdowns during model training and working on ways to optimize that process efficiently.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week was productive in terms of refining the project plan and the website. Moving forward, I need to focus more on the actual model implementation, ensuring I stay on track to meet my project goals. To improve the process, I’ll break down tasks even further, making each step more manageable.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Harper, a current student in the Computer Science Post-Baccalaureate program. I have a background in accounting and business management, and I decided to dive into computer science for its challenges and creative opportunities.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain, and I'm excited to explore how they can be applied across different industries. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, spending time with family, and working on coding projects to sharpen my skills.</p>
    <p>This website showcases my ongoing work and interests. Feel free to browse through my weekly project updates to see what I've been up to!</p>

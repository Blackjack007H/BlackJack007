    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 4</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
     Last week, I successfully loaded the pre-trained BERT model and began working on the tokenization process. I also made progress on fine-tuning the model for sentiment analysis, setting up the foundation for training it with my dataset. I continued making some minor website adjustments but held off on updating the project section.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my focus is on completing the fine-tuning process for BERT. I’ll train the model with my sentiment analysis dataset, evaluate its performance, and make adjustments as needed. I also plan to experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model’s accuracy. For now, I’ll hold off on any major website updates related to project results until I have more substantial progress in the upcoming weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
     I anticipate some challenges with model optimization and training time, which could affect progress. Additionally, I may need to explore alternative strategies or tools if the initial results aren’t as expected.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
     Last week’s incremental approach to the technical tasks worked well, especially focusing on smaller steps. I’ll continue this method for model fine-tuning and evaluation, making adjustments as necessary while ensuring that I stay on track without rushing into results.</p>

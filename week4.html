    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 4</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I successfully loaded the pre-trained BERT model and began preprocessing the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis. I ran initial tests to see how the model performs out of the box and started fine-tuning the model for better accuracy. I also made some adjustments to the website’s responsiveness, ensuring it works well across different devices. Balancing both tasks was challenging, but I managed to make progress on both fronts.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to focus heavily on model optimization. I’ll experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the performance of the fine-tuned BERT model. I’ll also begin evaluating the model using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Alongside this, I want to add a project portfolio section to the website to showcase my ongoing work.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    My main challenge right now is finding the right balance between improving the model’s performance and spending time on the website. Additionally, there might be some hurdles in hyperparameter tuning since it’s a trial-and-error process, and running these experiments can take time.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week was productive, but I noticed that I tend to underestimate the time it takes to fine-tune models and handle data preprocessing. This week, I’ll aim to create a more structured schedule to help allocate enough time for both model optimization and website development. Having specific goals for each task will help me stay on track.</p>

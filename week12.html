    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 12</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I finalized the evaluation of my fine-tuned BERT model, achieving an accuracy of 92% and balanced F1-scores of 0.93 for negative sentiment and 0.92 for positive sentiment. These results reflect the model’s reliable ability to classify sentiment and its strong performance across both classes. Additionally, I organized my initial documentation, structuring my findings and insights for presentation on the website. This included preparing explanations of my process and results to make them accessible and engaging for the target audience.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my main focus will be on refining and finalizing the documentation. I’ll work to clearly explain my methodology, key findings, and the significance of the model’s performance metrics. Additionally, I’ll create a draft of the website update that highlights the project’s journey, from initial goals to the final model evaluation, ensuring that my documentation is clear, organized, and visually appealing. If time allows, I’ll also begin preparing for the final presentation by identifying which parts of the project to emphasize.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No significant impediments at the moment. My main challenge will be ensuring the documentation and website updates are polished and accessible, catering to a broad audience as I approach the final stages.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s structured focus on documentation worked well, allowing me to stay organized and concentrate on refining each part. Moving forward, I’ll continue breaking down the documentation process into manageable sections, ensuring clarity and conciseness in the final presentation of my findings.</p>

    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 13</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I focused on refining and finalizing the documentation for the project. I made significant progress in clearly explaining my methodology, key findings, and the significance of the BERT model’s performance metrics. I also created a draft of the website update to highlight the project’s journey, emphasizing the transition from initial goals to the final model evaluation. Additionally, I began outlining the structure for my final presentation, identifying which aspects of the project should be highlighted for maximum impact.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my primary focus will be on implementing the “show work” section of the website. This feature will allow users to interact with key components of the backend, such as visualizing tokenization or sentiment scores for sample texts. I’ll also refine the website’s design to ensure seamless integration of these interactive elements, making the experience engaging and intuitive for users. Concurrently, I’ll finalize the documentation and presentation materials, preparing to share my results effectively in the final stages of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    The main challenge lies in ensuring the technical implementation of the “show work” feature is both functional and user-friendly. Balancing backend development with polishing the website and preparing for the final presentation will require careful time management.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s emphasis on documentation and website updates proved effective in keeping the project organized and aligned with its goals. This week, I’ll aim to carry that same structured approach into the backend development and design phases, ensuring progress remains steady as I approach the project’s conclusion.</p>

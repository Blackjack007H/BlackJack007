    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 5</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I dedicated most of my time to fine-tuning the BERT model and experimenting with various hyperparameters to improve its performance. I also evaluated the model using accuracy and precision, and while the results are promising, there is still room for improvement. Additionally, I added a project portfolio section to my website, which highlights the NLP project and provides a summary of my work so far.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to further optimize the BERT model by continuing hyperparameter tuning and exploring additional techniques, such as using different learning rates and batch sizes to improve performance. I also want to run more detailed evaluations, using F1-score and confusion matrices, to get a deeper understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. On the website front, I’ll refine the portfolio section with more detailed descriptions and results from the NLP project.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    The main challenge remains the computational time required for fine-tuning the model, which can delay the evaluation process. I also need to ensure that the improvements I make are measurable and not just based on minor tweaks that don't significantly affect performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week was productive, but I think I can improve the way I document my progress and results. Keeping track of the experiments and changes I make to the model will help in better understanding what works and what doesn’t. This week, I’ll focus on better documentation and aim for more structured experimentation to maximize efficiency.</p>

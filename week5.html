    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 5</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I continued fine-tuning the BERT model for sentiment analysis and ran initial evaluations to assess its performance. While I’ve started experimenting with hyperparameters, I’m taking time to carefully analyze each step and ensure I understand the effects of different settings. I also maintained the website without adding any new project-specific updates yet.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I’ll focus on deeper exploration of the current BERT model’s performance. I plan to spend more time understanding the evaluation metrics, running more tests, and analyzing where the model could be improved. This week will primarily be about gathering insights from the model’s behavior rather than rushing into optimization or new experiments.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    Fine-tuning the model and analyzing its performance may require extra time, especially to identify subtle improvements. I’m also cautious about over-optimizing too early and will approach the tuning process gradually.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
     Last week, I realized that diving too quickly into optimization could lead to missed insights, so I’m slowing down to better understand the underlying behavior of the model. Taking a more thoughtful approach to experimentation should help me stay aligned with the overall project timeline.</p>

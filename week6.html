    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 6</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I focused on analyzing the performance of the BERT model in more depth. I ran additional tests and spent time understanding the evaluation metrics, identifying areas where the model’s behavior could be improved. Rather than rushing into optimization, I took a careful approach to ensure I understood the model’s performance before moving forward.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to continue the gradual tuning of the BERT model, focusing on refining specific hyperparameters based on last week’s insights. I’ll also explore potential adjustments to the dataset to see if preprocessing improvements can enhance the model’s accuracy. Additionally, I’ll review the broader steps needed in the next few weeks to ensure the project stays aligned with the timeline.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    The challenge this week may lie in balancing the desire for improvement with the need to avoid over-optimizing too soon. I’ll need to be mindful of spending too much time on small gains in performance at this stage, and stay focused on larger goals.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Slowing down to better understand the BERT model’s performance has proven to be a valuable step in the process. This week, I’ll aim to find a balance between ongoing analysis and making gradual improvements. I’ll also begin planning ahead for any major changes I might need to implement in the coming weeks.</p>

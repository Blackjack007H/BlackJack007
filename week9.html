    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 9</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I wrapped up most of the hyperparameter tuning and continued analyzing the results from the fine-tuning of the BERT model. I also spent time refining the preprocessing steps, which helped improve the model’s performance slightly. In parallel, I started gathering more information on alternative approaches, though I haven’t moved forward with implementing any new models just yet. This planning stage has been useful in identifying potential next steps.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to complete the evaluation of the fine-tuned BERT model and finalize the model performance assessments. I’ll also continue researching alternative techniques in case they are needed in the later stages. Additionally, I’ll start preparing the initial documentation for the website, laying the groundwork for more detailed updates in the weeks to come. The focus will remain on solidifying the current model before considering any major changes.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No significant impediments at this point. However, as I get deeper into model evaluation, I may encounter some limitations in terms of performance, which could prompt me to explore new approaches sooner than planned.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week, I made good progress by balancing model tuning with research on potential future steps. This process has worked well so far, but I’ll need to be mindful of not spending too much time researching alternative approaches unless I confirm the need for them. Going forward, I’ll focus on wrapping up the current phase before making any significant shifts in direction.</p>

    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 3</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
     Last week, I focused on improving my personal web page, refining the design and layout to make it more polished and user-friendly. I also began researching best practices for using pre-trained models like BERT in sentiment analysis, which gave me a clearer understanding of how to approach the project. While I didn’t dive into the code as much as I would have liked, the groundwork was laid for a strong start.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to begin implementing the sentiment analysis model using BERT. I’ll start by loading the pre-trained model and dataset, then work on tokenization and exploring how to fine-tune the model for my specific task. At the same time, I’ll continue tweaking the website as needed to keep it aligned with the project’s progress.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No major impediments at the moment. I anticipate that understanding the intricacies of fine-tuning the model may be time-consuming, so I’m ready to allocate extra time for learning.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s time management was better, and balancing website improvements with the project research paid off. However, I think I can improve by diving into the technical implementation earlier in the week to leave more time for troubleshooting and testing later on.</p>

    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 3</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I focused on improving my personal website’s design and layout, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. I also began working on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, specifically by researching pre-trained models like BERT. I explored best practices for using them and began familiarizing myself with how to approach sentiment analysis. Setting up my environment for NLP took longer than expected, but I made progress and feel more confident about the project.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I plan to dive deeper into fine-tuning the BERT model for sentiment analysis. I’ll focus on loading the model, preprocessing the IMDb dataset, and running initial tests to understand how the model performs out of the box. My goal is to fine-tune the model and start evaluating its performance. Additionally, I want to keep refining the website by adding more interactivity and improving responsiveness for different screen sizes.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    One challenge I foresee is the complexity of fine-tuning NLP models. While I’ve done the research, the actual implementation could be tricky, and I’ll likely need to experiment with different hyperparameters. Additionally, balancing the technical work with further web design refinements will require good time management this week.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week, I spent more time on the website than I had planned, which slowed my progress on the NLP project. I think focusing too much on the design delayed my deeper dive into the technical work. This week, I’ll prioritize fine-tuning the NLP model while setting specific time slots for website improvements, ensuring I make consistent progress in both areas.</p>

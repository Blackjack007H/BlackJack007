        <h1>CSPB 3112: Sentiment Analysis Project</h1>
        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
        <p>Through this project, I aim to deepen my expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by developing a sentiment analysis tool that utilizes pre-trained models like BERT. By engaging with this project, I will enhance my skills in machine learning, data science, and model deployment. This experience will significantly expand my professional capabilities and open up opportunities for advanced applications of AI in various fields.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>This project is especially important to me because it aligns with my passion for emerging technologies and their real-world applications. NLP is a rapidly evolving field with immense potential, and working on this project will give me hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and techniques. Additionally, this project complements my career transition into tech by allowing me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical and impactful way.</p>

        <h3>Specific and Measurable Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Familiarize with Pre-trained Models: I will gain a thorough understanding of BERT and other pre-trained models by studying their architectures and applications.</li>
            <li>Data Preparation: I will efficiently preprocess and clean the IMDb movie review dataset to prepare it for analysis.</li>
            <li>Model Implementation: I will develop and fine-tune a sentiment analysis model using BERT to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.</li>
            <li>Performance Evaluation: I will assess the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</li>
            <li>Deployment: I will create a user-friendly interface for the sentiment analysis tool and deploy it on a web platform.</li>
            <li>Documentation: I will document the project progress, code, and results on a public portfolio site, including weekly updates and a final report.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risks to Project Completion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New Language or Working Environment: Working with NLP libraries and tools such as Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and TensorFlow might present a learning curve.</li>
            <li>Lack of Prior Experience: I have limited prior experience with sentiment analysis and pre-trained models, which could impact the project’s progress.</li>
            <li>Resource Constraints: The project may require significant computational resources for model training and evaluation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mitigation Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New Language or Working Environment: I will allocate time for self-study and tutorials on NLP libraries and tools. I will also engage with online communities and forums for additional support.</li>
            <li>Lack of Prior Experience: I will leverage online courses, documentation, and example projects to build my foundational knowledge. I may also collaborate with peers or seek mentorship if needed.</li>
            <li>Resource Constraints: I will utilize cloud-based platforms or university-provided resources to handle computational requirements. I will also optimize model training processes to minimize resource usage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Assessments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy of Sentiment Classification: I will measure the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model on the IMDb dataset.</li>
            <li>Performance Metrics: I will evaluate precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure that the model performs effectively.</li>
            <li>Usability of Interface: I will assess the user-friendliness and functionality of the web interface for the sentiment analysis tool.</li>
            <li>Documentation Quality: I will ensure that all project documentation is complete, clear, and well-organized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Completion Criteria</h3>
        <p>I will consider the project complete when the sentiment analysis tool is successfully developed, evaluated, and deployed. I will meet all my goals, including preparing a functional user interface, comprehensive documentation, and a final project report. My public portfolio will be updated with all relevant materials, including code, data, and progress updates.</p>

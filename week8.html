    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 8</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I focused on testing different combinations of hyperparameters and preprocessing adjustments for the BERT model. I also set clearer benchmarks for performance evaluation, which helped me stay focused on measurable improvements. In addition, I started gathering resources for exploring advanced techniques and other models, which will be useful for future phases of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I’ll concentrate on finalizing the current round of model tuning by comparing the results of various hyperparameter settings and preprocessing methods. Once I have a clear understanding of the model’s performance, I’ll shift focus to exploring alternative techniques or models, if needed, to see how they might complement or improve upon BERT. I’ll also continue building out my research for the upcoming stages of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    As the model tuning nears completion, there’s a possibility of diminishing returns with further adjustments. I’ll need to avoid over-optimizing the current model and be open to trying different approaches if I don’t see significant improvements.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s emphasis on setting clear benchmarks and staying focused on measurable progress helped me make more efficient use of my time. I’ll continue using this approach but remain flexible in case I need to pivot to different models or techniques in the coming weeks.</p>

    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 11</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I successfully finalized the evaluation of my fine-tuned BERT model. The results were highly promising, with an accuracy of 92% and strong F1-scores across both classes (0.93 for negative and 0.92 for positive). These metrics demonstrate the model’s balanced performance and its reliable ability to classify sentiment. In addition to evaluating the model, I continued gathering resources on alternative NLP techniques, which I plan to explore in future projects or as possible enhancements to this one. I also progressed on initial documentation, organizing my findings and model insights to prepare for sharing them on the website.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, my focus will be on consolidating the insights from BERT’s evaluation and determining if any final adjustments are necessary. Once satisfied with the model’s performance, I’ll shift to drafting more detailed documentation to explain my process and key findings, making it ready for the website update. I’ll also prioritize highlighting specific aspects of my findings to ensure they are accessible and engaging for my target audience. This approach will help me communicate the model’s strengths and the value it brings to sentiment analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    At the moment, there are no significant impediments. My primary task will be to organize and clarify the documentation, ensuring it’s thorough and easy to understand for a broad audience as I move toward the final presentation of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s structured approach to model evaluation and documentation was effective, allowing me to focus deeply on each task without feeling overwhelmed. This organization was key to achieving a well-rounded evaluation of the model while laying the groundwork for the documentation phase. Moving forward, I plan to continue this process, making incremental improvements to documentation practices to maintain clarity and conciseness as I share results with the project’s audience.</p>

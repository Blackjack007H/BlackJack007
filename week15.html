    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 15</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I completed all remaining tasks for my final project. I finalized the Hugging Face demo and ensured the documentation was polished and comprehensive. Additionally, I uploaded the completed Final Project Report to the website, summarizing the project’s process, results, and conclusions. Everything is now ready for presentation, and the entire project is cohesive and well-documented.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week marks the conclusion of my project. My focus will be on reviewing the final submission to ensure all elements are properly aligned and accessible. I will also take time to reflect on the entire process and document key takeaways and lessons learned. Finally, I plan to present the project, sharing my findings and showcasing the demo to peers and instructors.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    There are no impediments at this stage. The project is complete, and my focus is on ensuring a smooth presentation and submission process.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s work was highly organized and focused, allowing me to complete all tasks efficiently. The step-by-step approach to polishing the project ensured that nothing was overlooked. Looking back on the entire process, I’ve learned the importance of planning, resource management, and iterative improvement in successfully completing a large-scale project. I’m proud of the results and confident in the work I’ve accomplished.</p>

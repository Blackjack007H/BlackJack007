    <h1>Weekly Update - Week 7</h1>

    <p><strong>What did I do last week?</strong><br>
    Last week, I continued fine-tuning the BERT model by focusing on specific hyperparameters and experimenting with dataset preprocessing techniques. I also took some time to plan the next steps in the project to ensure I’m staying on track with the overall timeline. This careful approach helped me identify a few potential areas for improvement without rushing into too many changes at once.</p>

    <p><strong>What do I plan to do this week?</strong><br>
    This week, I’ll refine the model further by testing different combinations of hyperparameters and preprocessing adjustments. I plan to spend more time evaluating the model’s results against specific benchmarks I’ve set for performance. In parallel, I’ll start gathering resources and research on other advanced techniques in case I need to pivot to different models or methods later in the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in my way?</strong><br>
    No major impediments for now, but I’m aware that further optimization may yield diminishing returns. I need to balance the time spent on model tuning with planning for the next stages of the project.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the process used last week, and how can I make the process work better?</strong><br>
    Last week’s focus on gradual refinement worked well, but I realized that setting more specific performance benchmarks earlier in the week would have been helpful. Going forward, I’ll be more proactive in defining what I want to achieve with each tuning experiment to stay focused on measurable progress.</p>
